Postgraduate and international students balance demanding studies, work, and visas while adapting to a new country, yet their voices are often overlooked. As a first year MIDEC student, I am committed to ensuring equitable support and opportunities for all coursework students across Law, Governance & Policy.

My priorities are:

1.  **Equitable Careers:** Advocate for tailored career expo, internships, and pathways into law, governance, security, and policy roles.
2.  **Interdisciplinary Opportunities:** Promote collaboration across schools under CLGP through joint seminars and policy projects.
3.  **Research & Mentorship:** Strengthen access to faculty, alumni, and research networks for coursework students to help build their academic and professional credentials.
4.  **Increased Support & Skills:** Expand health and wellbeing initiatives; as well as academic writing, legal research, and policy skills workshops tailored to international and postgraduate students.
5.  **Accessible Learning:** Campaign for affordable textbooks, more e-texts, and extended library access.
6.  **Transparency:** Establish regular postgraduate forums and surveys to ensure our voices are heard.
