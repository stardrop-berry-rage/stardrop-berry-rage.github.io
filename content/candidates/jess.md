Hey ANU, I'm Jess and I am running to be your rep for the College of Law, Governance, and Policy in 2025 with RAGE for ANUSA.

As a first-year student studying Laws and International Relations, I am passionate about students being able to have a say in their degrees. I understand how concerning it is watching our education be affected by decisions in which we have little to no input. As CLGP rep, I will fight to put control over our degrees in student hands.

That's why, if you vote me for CLGP rep, I will advocate for the needs of students, which includes:

**Fair access to extensions**

Currently, getting even a small extension on an assignment requires documentation. With the difficulties associated with getting this documentation, it is often unreasonable for a student who is sick or struggling with other issues to arrange it, causing them to have to simply tough out their difficult circumstances so that they don't receive a late penalty.

As CLGP rep, I will ensure that everyone can access 5-day extensions without the need for documentation. This change is already implemented in some courses in other colleges across ANU and so standardising this practice will ensure that students can get help when they need it.

**Greater accountability to student feedback**

While SELT feedback surveys are a fantastic opportunity for students to provide feedback on courses for both the academics running the course and students who are interested in it, there is little accountability for the College to respond to this feedback. This is particularly concerning for compulsory courses, where some overall learning experience scores are currently as low as 42%.

As CLGP rep, I will implement a system where a tangible response to improve courses with very low SELT survey responses. The academic colleges will be required to outline the changes made to courses with unsatisfactory feedback in a transparent manner so that they can be held accountable.

**Bring the Enquiries Team back to the CLGP**

The proposed changes to the Academic portfolio at ANU will cause the Enquires Team to become part of a centralised structure rather than being College specific. The Enquires Team is crucial to organising degree planning, extensions, accreditation, deferments, academic updates, exchanges, and room hire. As specific knowledge is required to handle these concerns when related to law degrees, many enquiries will be passed onto academic staff, taking time away from their teaching responsibilities.

As CLGP rep, I will ensure that the Enquires Team is decentralised and remains college specific so that enquires related to our degrees can receive the most accurate answers and so that staff can remain focused on teaching to retain the quality of our degrees.

I'm also proud to be running with RAGE for ANUSA:
*   Delivering the services you need
*   Building the campus you want
*   Fighting for the education you deserve

Thanks so much for your time and support! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to let me know.

Remember to vote from the 21st to the 25th of September.
