## Manifesto 1 – Postgraduate Coursework Officer

**Kamal Hassan (he/him)**  
Master of International Relations  
Running with RAGE for ANUSA 2025

Postgraduate students are the heart of ANU’s teaching and research, yet we are too often treated as an afterthought. From rushed technological changes to declining academic standards and cost-cutting, our learning conditions are at stake. I’m running to ensure that **postgraduates have a strong voice inside ANUSA** and that ANU delivers the world-class experience we were promised.

### What I will fight for as Postgraduate Coursework Officer

1. **Fix the Canvas chaos**  
   - Demand a **full audit of Canvas issues** and publish a timeline for fixes.  
   - Ensure **comprehensive staff training** so students aren’t beta-testers.  
   - Establish a **student-driven complaints and feedback mechanism** with guaranteed follow-up.  

2. **Transparency in marking and rubrics**  
   - Push for **college-wide, pre-released rubrics** for every type of assessment.  
   - Require **detailed post-mark breakdowns** (e.g., 80/100 for referencing, 60/100 for presentation) so students know exactly where to improve.  
   - Enforce **consistent rubric use** across courses to end assessment guesswork.  

3. **Stop the cuts and defend teaching quality**  
   - Work with NTEU and student campaigns to prevent any return of cuts.  
   - Work with college reps to **protect small class sizes and high-quality teaching**.  

4. **Bring ANUSA to postgraduates**  
   - Run **open meetings and workshops** in colleges and residential halls.  
   - Ensure postgraduate concerns directly shape ANUSA policy and action.  

I will bring my experience – from a previous UWA student leader to policy and organisational worker and ANU IRSoc Postgrad Officer – to fight for a **transparent, experienced, and genuinely postgraduate-focused ANUSA.**

## Manifesto 2 – Postgraduate Member on ANU Council (PMAC)

**Kamal Hassan (he/him)**  
Master of International Relations  
Running with RAGE for ANUSA 2025

The **ANU Council** is the university’s top governing body. Its decisions shape every aspect of our education and working conditions – budgets, hiring, campus planning – yet too often it operates in secrecy. The recent resignation of Vice-Chancellor Genevieve Bell is a testament of how urgently we need **genuine student power and accountability** at the highest level.

I’m running to ensure that postgraduate students, and the entire ANU community, have a **fierce, transparent, and uncompromising voice** inside the Council chamber.

### What I will fight for as Postgraduate Member of Council

1. **Real accountability and transparency**  
   - Demand **regular and easily accessible public release of Council agendas, minutes, and key decisions**.  
   - Hold the Vice-Chancellor, Chancellor, and senior management **directly accountable** for their actions, ensuring no one is silenced, bullied, or ignored.  

2. **Better governance for ANU’s future**  
   - Champion a Council that **invests in teaching and research excellence, environmental sustainability, and long-term student welfare**, not short-term corporate savings.  
   - Push for **independent oversight of major restructures** to prevent repeats of “Renew ANU” and protect staff and students alike.  

3. **Strong postgraduate representation**  
   - Ensure the **voices of coursework and research postgraduates** inform every decision on fees, course quality, and campus life.  
   - Work in tandem with the undergraduate Council member and ANUSA to present a **united student front**.  

I will take the fight for **transparent, student-centred governance** directly to the highest decision-making body of the university. Because ANU belongs to its students and staff, not to secretive boards.
