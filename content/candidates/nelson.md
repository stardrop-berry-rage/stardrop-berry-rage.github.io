Hi ANU, I’m Nelson, a first-year Political Science student running as a General Representative in this upcoming ANUSA election. I study political science so that I can understand the institutions around us, and their impact on our lives. The ANU is one such institution.

As a student living on campus, I am acutely aware of the importance of Res Coms and their responsibility not least for major events, but for making our home-away-from-home welcoming and inclusive for all people Contempt for students has been shown by the university’s new Res Com model which seeks to standardise structures, control budgets and diminish democracy in our halls.

  - a. What can I be expected to do on this matter?

    - i. I will advocate for student rights and fight for our Res Coms to retain their autonomy and;

    - ii. ensure that students remain up-to-date on proposed changes and;

    - iii. liaise with halls to advocate for their needs and make them heard.

Not only are our Res Coms on the line, but so too are our degrees. Political Science, International Relations and Public Policy students are currently being threatened with a proposed amalgamation which would see our degrees combined into just one.

By choosing to attend the ANU, I sought a university with international credentials and an academic environment designed to challenge and engage new students. My time at the ANU has shown – as many of you have also experienced – that tutorials are overcrowded and infrequent. With as many as 30 students crammed in to bi-weekly tutorials, how are we expected to be getting the most from an arguably costly degree?

  - a. As your Gen Rep and RAGER, you can rely on me to fight for tutorials to return to what they ought to be: specialised time with tutors in an uncrowded environment.

As a student, having to move away from home for university was not easy; especially in regard to financial independence. One such hurdle was accessing Youth Allowance.

  - a. I will work with the NUS (National Union of Students) to advocate for Youth Allowance reform to make it easier for you and I to access. This is vital as many of us rely on youth allowance to survive.

  - b. I will endeavour toward the creation of a report on how Youth Allowance has affected students and their experiences accessing it.
