1. Wider implementation of flexible submission periods across all CBE courses especially for assessments with weightings of 20% or less. This will provide students with the flexibility and support to accommodate obligations outside of university.

2. Mid-semester surveys to improve communication and provide a channel for feedback on tutorial pacing and concerns regarding content and assessments.

3. Tutorial participation via Zoom will be available as a support option for students facing difficulties attending in person. Where there is a participation weighting, to encourage students attending in person, they will receive a 5% participation mark. For those attending via Zoom, the equivalent 5% will be reallocated to the mid-semester exam or assignment.
