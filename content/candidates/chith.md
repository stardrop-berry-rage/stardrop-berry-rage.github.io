# Fighting for the education you deserve

## No cuts

I will **fight for your education** by standing against the cuts and advocating to reverse Renew ANU in the relevant fora, as well as continuing to support the student and staff protests.

## Better learning conditions

I will **fight for your education** by:

* Advocating for smaller tutorial sizes as classes are overcrowded, and demanding the ANU to release their reasoning for making the classes bigger to begin with.  
* Fighting against the DVCA cuts to speed up student support. You deserve extensions and deferrals on time.  
* Advocating for a student-centred, clear, forward-thinking and accessible AI policy, building on the Gen-AI report.  
* Expanding book and technology bursaries, and creating a new ANUSA learning materials subsidy for students in STEM and the Arts.

## Accessibility 

* Night-time tutorial options and standardised assessment deadlines for students who work full-time or with other commitments.  
* BYOD exams where applicable to improve accessibility and bring ANU exams into the 21st century.  
* Expanding the alternative assessments policy to all parts of ANU to improve accessibility, creativity and fairness. You may find your niche here\! 

## Fairer assessments 

* Flexible weighting options where applicable so that assessments count in ways that benefit the student the most.  
* Five day simple extensions with lower late penalties in the interim so that you do not have to endure the cost and anxiety of sourcing a doctor last minute.  
* More redemptive measures because failing one assessment should not mean you fail the course. I also support strictly limiting hurdle tasks.  
* Push for clearer assessment rubrics, appeals processes, and preparatory materials like past exams so you are able to give each task your best shot.

# Delivering the services you need

I will **deliver the services you need by:**

* Campaigning to restore bulk-billed GPs to ANU because healthcare is a human right; it ought not be inaccessible on the basis of your income or visa-status.  
* Defending your Res Coms because they are a cornerstone of one of the best and most unique experiences at the ANU, college life.   
* Pushing to create an ANUSA Regional, Remote and Rural (RRR) Department because RRR students deserve avenues for proper advocacy and autonomy.
