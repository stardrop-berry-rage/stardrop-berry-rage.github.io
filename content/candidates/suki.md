My name is Suki and I’m running for ANUSA General Representative in 2025. As a Gen Rep on
the RAGE Ticket, I am committed to delivering the services you need, building the campus you
want, and fighting for the education you deserve.
I’m a first-year Law and PPE student, originally from Sydney, and I’m passionate about getting
involved in student politics. I want to be part of a team that not only supports student voices and
concerns, but also acts on them.
If elected, I will remain committed to the policies I’ve outlined, while also being adaptable and
responsive to other issues brought to me by you, the students.

1. My first focus is tackling parking costs. University life is already expensive, and for many
of us, cars are essential for getting to work, classes, appointments and home. In just one
year, ANU has raised parking from $2.81 to $7.78 per day, a sudden increase of more
than 200%! This is part of an ANU wide push to cut costs and increase revenue and we,
the students, are the ones paying for it. These raises are unsustainable and put
unnecessary pressure on students who rely on their cars every day. Action will include
liaising with the parking office at ANU to discuss decreases in the cost of parking as well
as actively fighting against any further price increases.I am committed to working to cut
these costs and prevent further raises, while ensuring parking remains affordable and
accessible for ANU students.

2. My second focus is protecting student social life. ANU has one of the most active
campus social scenes in the country, and for many of us, that was a huge part of why we
chose to study here. However, there have been recent moves, such as banning free
pour in all residential colleges and other recent moves that threaten student culture.
While promoting safe and responsible drinking behaviour is essential, we also have the
right to choose what activities we engage in, with college life and campus events being a
huge part of the ANU experience. As Gen Rep, I would seek to protect ANU from any
restrictions which would affect our social life as well as continuing to support and
improve safe drinking initiatives.

3. My third focus is advocating for affordable access to digital textbooks. Our degrees are
expensive, and the cost of textbooks, particularly for textbook heavy courses such as
Law, English and STEM, can see students spending $100’s of dollars in a single
semester! We deserve to have access to these resources without such large personal
expense. For example, in my Contracts course, there are only three free online
textbooks for a cohort of over 400! In my role, I would seek to establish a fund that would
provide enough digital textbooks to cover 25% of the cohort size, ensuring the increased
availability of affordable online resources.
