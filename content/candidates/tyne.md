Hey ANU!  

My name is **Tyne**, and I am running to be a **General Representative (Gen Rep)** on ANUSA. I want to be part of an ANUSA that represents and supports students, so that everyone feels that they are welcome, heard, and part of our campus community.  

I‚Äôm a first year **International Relations and Political Science** student, passionate about productive government‚ÄìNFP (not-for-profit) relationships and Australia‚Äôs evolving role in the Indo-Pacific. A student from Sydney, I currently work with a government and media relations firm and am a member of the Ku-ring-gai Council Youth Advisory Committee, experiences that have given me insight into effective advocacy, community engagement, and representation.  

If I‚Äôm elected as a Gen Rep, I will focus on making sure all students feel safe and supported, and that the university keeps student wellbeing at the centre of its priorities.

## 1. Fair, Flexible, and Student-Centred Assessment Support

### No Hassle Assessment Alternatives through Educational Access Plans (EAPs)
At the moment, if your doctor recommends an alternative assessment (like a take-home instead of an exam), you have to apply repeatedly to the Exams Office, sometimes dozens of times across your degree.  

I want to make sure **alternative assessments can be written directly into your EAP**, so once it‚Äôs approved by the Accessibility team, you‚Äôre covered. This will reduce stress, save you time, and give you certainty that your needs will be accommodated.  

### Securing Your Right to Reapply in Extenuating Circumstance Applications (ECAs)
Right now, if your ECA (how you access extended deadlines, deferred exams, alternative assessments) is rejected and the appeal fails, that‚Äôs it‚Äîeven if there‚Äôs a recommendation from your doctor.  

I‚Äôll fight for a system where you can **reapply for a different provision if your appeal fails**, ensuring no student is ever left without other options for support from the Exams Office. That means more fairness, more flexibility, and much better alignment with your actual health needs.

## 2. Accessible and Reliable Mental Health Support

### Specialist Grief Support When You Need It Most
Right now, ANU doesn‚Äôt provide grief-specific counselling. I want to change that by **securing a formal partnership with an external specialist provider.**  

That means if you experience loss, you‚Äôll have fast, professional, free access to grief-specific support without being turned away or put on a waiting list.  

### Strengthened Priority Counselling After Critical Incidents
Currently, priority counselling for students affected by a critical incident ends after no more than two weeks. That‚Äôs not enough.  

I‚Äôll work to extend it to **six weeks**, matching ANU‚Äôs existing six-session model. That means that students who need it can access consistent, reliable mental health support throughout the hardest period, not just the first fortnight.

I‚Äôm excited to be running with **RAGE**, a ticket that will fight to deliver the services you need, build the campus you want, and the education you deserve!  

Thank you so much for your time and support! I‚Äôd love to hear any questions or ideas you have on how we can make ANU a more supportive and inclusive place for all students.
