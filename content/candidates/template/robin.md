My name is Robin, and I believe in a student union that delivers real results. For too long, students have been told to accept things the way they are. I'm running to be your General Representative and NUS Delegate because I want to work constructively to make student life better and more affordable, not just talk about it.

It's about focusing on the practical issues that affect us every day. I'm committed to fighting for a campus that is more supportive, more accessible, and more focused on you.

## My Plan as Your General Representative

*   **A Real 24/7 Student Space:** I will work directly with the university to finally secure a fully-funded, safe, and accessible 24/7 common room for all students, with proper amenities like microwaves, kettles, and comfortable study spaces.
*   **Better Food, Cheaper Prices:** Iâ€™ll fight to expand the variety of affordable food options on campus. This includes lobbying for longer opening hours and supporting student-run initiatives that drive down costs for everyone.
*   **Stronger Academic Safety Nets:** Your academic success should be supported. I will advocate for a standardized, university-wide extension request system to ensure fairness and transparency. I'll also push for increased funding for free peer-tutoring programs in high-failure rate courses.
*   **Fixing Your Commute:** I will work with Transport Canberra and the university to increase the frequency and reliability of bus routes to and from campus, especially after hours, and secure funding for more weatherproof, secure bike storage.

## My Goal as Your NUS Delegate

*   **A Stronger Voice in Ballarat:** As your delegate to the National Union of Students, my single focus will be representing ANU students effectively on the national stage. I will lobby federal politicians for increased student income support and a fairer HECS-HELP system.
*   **Bringing Results Home:** The NUS should be about delivering tangible benefits. I will work to ensure that ANU students see a real return from our NUS affiliation through coordinated national campaigns that have a direct, positive impact on our cost of living and quality of education.
*   **Accountability and Focus:** I will provide clear and regular reports on my work at a national level. My priority is to focus on the core issues of student funding, welfare, and educational quality.
