Experience matters. Over the past year, we have built a student union that is financially stable, that has expanded student services, and that has successfully advocated for students at the highest levels of the university. This is not the time for risky experiments; it's the time for a steady hand to continue the work and deliver even more for ANU students.

As your current General Representative, I have a proven track record of getting things done. I have the relationships and the know-how to hit the ground running from day one. I'm running for President because I have a realistic plan to build on our success.

## My Plan as Your President

*   **Protecting and Expanding Student Services:** I will secure long-term funding for our vital student assistance programs, including the emergency grant system and the student food pantry, ensuring they can support more students than ever before.
*   **A Better Deal for Clubs:** Our clubs are the heart of campus life. I will streamline the club funding process, cut the red tape for event approvals, and increase the total pool of funding available for clubs and societies.
*   **Making Your Degree Work for You:** I will work with ANU Careers to create more faculty-specific internship and graduate placement programs, directly connecting you with employers in your field. Your ANUSA should be invested in your future.

## My Role on ANU Council (UMAC)

*   **A Strong Voice Where It Counts:** The most important decisions about university spending, campus development, and academic policy are made in committees. I already have a seat at the table. I will continue to use my position to ensure student priorities are at the center of the university's budget and long-term strategy.
*   **Scrutinizing University Spending:** I will fight to ensure your student fees are being used effectively and not wasted on vanity projects. I will advocate for more investment in core teaching, library resources, and essential student support services.

## My Commitment as Your NUS Delegate

*   **Effective National Representation:** I have the experience to navigate the National Union of Students and make sure ANU's voice is heard. My focus will be on building cross-campus alliances to lobby the federal government on the issues that matter: lowering the cost of living, fixing student housing, and fighting for a fairer HECS-HELP system.
*   **No Distractions, Just Results:** My commitment is to you, the students of ANU. I will use the national platform to bring tangible campaign wins for students here on campus and across Australia.
