# Campaign Summary
Hi everyone, I’m Ankith, and I’m excited to re-nominate as your Parents and Carers’ Officer for 2025! Over the past year, I’ve worked hard to strengthen supports for student parents and carers.  

A key achievement was negotiating changes to the Parents and Carers Grant, making it $1,000 annually instead of per degree, ensuring fairer access. I also developed the **Parents and Carers Information Hub**, soon to launch, which will centralize university, city, and federal supports. Alongside this, I’ve initiated collaboration with Carers ACT, continued advocacy around EAPs and ECAs, and worked to improve awareness of carer-friendly spaces on campus.  

In 2025, I’ll build on this momentum—launching and expanding the Information Hub, strengthening partnerships, improving academic flexibility, and prioritizing mental health and wellbeing supports.  

**My goal is simple: to create a more inclusive, supportive environment where student parents and carers can thrive at ANU.**

## 1. Parents and Carers Grant – Ongoing Review and Advocacy
This year, I successfully negotiated changes to the Parents and Carers Grant, making it **$1,000 annually rather than per degree**. In the coming year, I will continue to review its effectiveness, advocate for fairer access, and explore options for additional hardship top-ups when unexpected caregiving costs arise.

## 2. Parents and Carers Information Hub – Launch and Growth
The hub I developed this year, which centralizes university, city, and federal supports, is expected to launch in the next term. I will ensure it stays updated and expand it with resources identified by students, making it a living tool for our community.

---

## 3. Stronger Community Connections
I began to work on forming a strategic collaboration with Carers ACT. Next year, I will try to formalize this partnership, delivering tailored workshops, and host an event in collaboration with Carers ACT to foster peer support among parents and carers.

---

## 4. Academic Flexibility and Advocacy
I have actively pushed for improvements in EAPs and ECAs this year. In the coming year, I will continue this advocacy, working with teaching staff and the university to embed clear, carer-friendly flexibility guidelines that reduce stress for students balancing caregiving and study.

---

## 5. Campus Accessibility and Inclusion
Building on advocacy for carer-friendly spaces, I will push for better upkeep and awareness of parenting rooms, change tables, and quiet areas. My goal is to ensure these facilities are not only available but also comfortable.

---

## 6. Mental Health and Wellbeing
This year, I began highlighting the mental health challenges faced by carers and parents. Next year, I will work with ANU Counselling and external partners to offer low-barrier wellbeing sessions and promote tailored supports for our community.
