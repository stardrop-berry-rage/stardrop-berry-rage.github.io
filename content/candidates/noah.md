Hi everyone\! My name is Noah McMillan and I am a postgraduate student at the ANU doing a masters in History. I am originally from Jervis Bay, and did my undergrad at the University of Wollongong and I am running to be your postgraduate College of Arts and Social Sciences (CASS) rep for 2026\!

Voting is from the 22nd to the 25th of September at [https://www.voteanusa.com/elections/](https://www.voteanusa.com/elections/)

Now more than ever it is so important to have strong representation for postgraduate CASS students as the ANU is cutting more and more of our lecturers and supervisors and jeopardising our education.

As your Postgrad CASS rep I will:

ðŸ–¤**Advocate for better learning spaces**  
Despite the money ANU claims to have spent on its buildings, classrooms and lecture halls like the Tank have roofs filled with rodents, leaves and possum ðŸ’© and they do not provide a welcoming environment to students and staff alike\! As a CASS rep I will advocate for

- Cleaner walkways into classrooms  
    
- Stop Barry Drive being used as a lecture space and ensure all spaces used are appropriate for class size and learning  
    
- Call for the ANU to implement semester to year long lockers for CASS Postgradsâ€¦if the law and music schools have them then so should we\!  
    
- Fight for a dedicated space on campus for postgrad CASS students to gather and collaborate.   
    
- Work with our clubs candidate \[tag dylan adams\] to find a place for CASS related clubs storage beyond ANU Sport

ðŸ–¤**Help provide resources for low income students**  
In a cost of living crisis now more than ever we need to do more to support low SES students in covering the high high costs of university resources needed for classes. That's why I willâ€¦

- Support an initiative for English students to donate their textbooks to the library for future students to use  
    
- Help encourage a relationship between Chifley and the Arts Library with the literature school to increase availability of textbooks

ðŸ–¤**CASS learning reforms**  
In the wake of RenewANU there are some distinct needs for change on how our courses are delivered and whether they are there at all. That's why I will call on the ANU too:

- Provide certainty and predictability for courses in advance to allow for better degree planning  
    
- Implement a careers and employability team for CASS that runs events to help out (similar to the one CBE already has) and improve outreach with ANU Careers and CASS students.  
    
- Reform excursion attendance for the literature school and make sure attendance at excursions will not count for non attendance in other classes.
