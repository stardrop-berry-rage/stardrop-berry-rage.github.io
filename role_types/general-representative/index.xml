My name is Olivia (Liv) and I am more than excited to run on ANUSA with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; as your General Representative. Currently studying a Bachelors in Law &amp;amp; Political Science, I have always had a massive passion in politics, particularly concerning feminism and education. This leads to my desire to deliver the services you &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;deserve&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt;. Hence, in this election, I wish to address and work with university leadership to improve campus safety for women and make it easier for &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; to afford education.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Max Agnew</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/max/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/max/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Nelson Sargent</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/nelson/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/nelson/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi ANU, I’m Nelson, a first-year Political Science student running as a General Representative in this upcoming ANUSA election. I study political science so that I can understand the institutions around us, and their impact on our lives. The ANU is one such institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a student living on campus, I am acutely aware of the importance of Res Coms and their responsibility not least for major events, but for making our home-away-from-home welcoming and inclusive for all people Contempt for students has been shown by the university’s new Res Com model which seeks to standardise structures, control budgets and diminish democracy in our halls.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ollie Walsh</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/ollie/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/ollie/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Seamus Giveen</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/seamus/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/seamus/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Suki Waddel</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/suki/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/suki/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Suki and I’m running for ANUSA General Representative in 2025. As a Gen Rep on
the RAGE Ticket, I am committed to delivering the services you need, building the campus you
want, and fighting for the education you deserve.
I’m a first-year Law and PPE student, originally from Sydney, and I’m passionate about getting
involved in student politics. I want to be part of a team that not only supports student voices and
concerns, but also acts on them.
If elected, I will remain committed to the policies I’ve outlined, while also being adaptable and
responsive to other issues brought to me by you, the students.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tessa McNamara</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/tessa/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/tessa/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;CW: Sexual Assault / Sexual Harassment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi ANU, I’m Tessa McNamara (she/her) and I’m running to be a GenRep for ANUSA 2026. I believe that it is the responsibility of ANUSA to ensure a safe and comfortable learning environment for the students of ANU, as well as advocating against any cuts to the quality of our education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first year PPE/Arts student from interstate, I’m so grateful for the welcoming community I’ve found at ANU, but understand how tough university life can be. Uni should be a time of learning and socialising, but with stressors like exams, social/financial anxiety and moving away from home, mental health support is vital to students&amp;rsquo; wellbeing and should be protected by your student union.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tyne Jones</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/tyne/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/tyne/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hey ANU!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is &lt;strong&gt;Tyne&lt;/strong&gt;, and I am running to be a &lt;strong&gt;General Representative (Gen Rep)&lt;/strong&gt; on ANUSA. I want to be part of an ANUSA that represents and supports students, so that everyone feels that they are welcome, heard, and part of our campus community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a first year &lt;strong&gt;International Relations and Political Science&lt;/strong&gt; student, passionate about productive government–NFP (not-for-profit) relationships and Australia’s evolving role in the Indo-Pacific. A student from Sydney, I currently work with a government and media relations firm and am a member of the Ku-ring-gai Council Youth Advisory Committee, experiences that have given me insight into effective advocacy, community engagement, and representation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
