      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Robin, and I believe in a student union that delivers real results. For too long, students have been told to accept things the way they are. I&amp;rsquo;m running to be your General Representative and NUS Delegate because I want to work constructively to make student life better and more affordable, not just talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about focusing on the practical issues that affect us every day. I&amp;rsquo;m committed to fighting for a campus that is more supportive, more accessible, and more focused on you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
