I’ve grown up playing Cricket and AFL, so I know how tough it can be navigating girls&amp;rsquo; sport in such male-dominated spaces. I’m super passionate about making sport fun, welcoming, and open to everyone, no matter your skill level or background. I’m a proud player on the ANU Griffins, and honestly, most of my best friends and strongest memories have come from time spent on the sporting field.&lt;br&gt;
Back in high school, I spent most of my time squaring up for girls’ sport; starting new teams, organising guest speakers and events, and perfecting the art of a passive-aggressive email when things needed to get done.&lt;br&gt;
As Gen Rep I’d be committed to strengthening the connection between ANUSA and ANU Sport, so we can build more inclusive and supportive sporting communities on campus. I want to make our sports as fun, open and accessible to everyone as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>April Chesher</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/april/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/april/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My name is April Chesher, I’m a Politics/International Relations student living at the wonderful Burton and Garran Hall, and I am so excited to be running for the position of General Representative in the upcoming 2025 ANUSA elections. I want to deliver an ANU campus that is lively, fun, and safe for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand what it’s like to walk through campus to the Barry Drive bus stop on dark winter mornings and have made the lightless trek back from Civic after a night out. The lack of lighting currently around campus is a dangerous failure of the university that I will work to fix.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Audrey Clementine</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/audrey/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/audrey/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I’m Audrey, a first-year Arts student studying English and living at B&amp;amp;G college. During term time I can usually be found at Badger (pretending to study), Lab (pretending to study), or at Chifley basement actually studying. (Against my will!)&lt;br&gt;
I’m running for Gen Rep because I believe that campus should be more than just functional; it should be comfortable and creative, a place people can congregate socially and have a good time! That’s why my policy focuses on cooling down Uni Ave with better shade, keeping creative spaces (like the Art &amp;amp; Design library!) open for longer and offering something sweet during the summer exam period heat; a free ice cream truck for students! I want to make ANU a place that supports and sustains us beyond the lecture hall; sun-safe, study-safe and sanity-safe. Vote me for a cooler campus! (Literally.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Edu Setiawan</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/edu/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/edu/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m Edu (he/him), a first-year arts student and current ressie at B&amp;amp;G. I&amp;rsquo;m running with the RAGE ticket to be one of your General Representatives on ANUSA for next year. With my platform, I&amp;rsquo;ll fight for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A workable university policy on the use of Generative AI in student assessments to bring our education into the 21st Century.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving the social scene on campus through developing options for attracting new F&amp;amp;B outlets to this uni, with particular preference to bringing the first Yo-Chi in Canberra!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making digital textbooks the norm, and supporting students with the costs of obtaining physical textbooks where possible, to make class resources accessible for all to the greatest possible extent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expanding usable spaces at the Bryan Kenyon Student Space (BKSS) to make ANUSA, its facilities and the organisation an approachable and useful resource on campus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first-year student who also struggles with the stress of our university assessments, it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly important that we have a student union that fights for students&amp;rsquo; academic interests and continually improves its service offerings to meet student needs. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m proud to be running with the RAGE ticket.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Indigo Warwick</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/indigo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/indigo/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Isabel Moller</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/isabel/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/isabel/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Liv Yu</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/liv/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/liv/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;HELLO ANU!!! My name is Olivia (Liv) and I am more than excited to run on ANUSA with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; as your General Representative. Currently studying a Bachelors in Law &amp;amp; Political Science, I have always had a massive passion in politics, particularly concerning feminism and education. This leads to my desire to deliver the services you &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;deserve&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt;. Hence, in this election, I wish to address and work with university leadership to improve campus safety for women and make it easier for &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; to afford education.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Max Agnew</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/max/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/max/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;HI! I’m Max, I moved from regional South Australia to study at ANU, and I’m committed to being a strong voice for regional students while building a campus that is more sustainable, supportive, and student-focused. That’s why I’m running on three key policies. First, Bring Back Bubblers: students shouldn’t have to rely on expensive bottled water. By installing more accessible, bottle-friendly taps across campus, we can cut plastic waste, save money, and keep everyone hydrated. Second, More Bins on Campus: overflowing rubbish undermines our community and environment. I’ll push for more bins and better signage, making it easier to do the right thing and keep our spaces clean. Finally, Post-Exam Badger Snack Subsidy: exams are stressful, and students deserve the chance to celebrate their hard work with affordable snacks at Badger &amp;amp; Co. Together, these policies will make ANU cleaner, greener, and more enjoyable for all students.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Nelson Sargent</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/nelson/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/nelson/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi ANU, I’m Nelson, a first-year Political Science student running as a General Representative in this upcoming ANUSA election. I study political science so that I can understand the institutions around us, and their impact on our lives. The ANU is one such institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a student living on campus, I am acutely aware of the importance of Res Coms and their responsibility not least for major events, but for making our home-away-from-home welcoming and inclusive for all people Contempt for students has been shown by the university’s new Res Com model which seeks to standardise structures, control budgets and diminish democracy in our halls.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ollie Walsh</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/ollie/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/ollie/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Seamus Giveen</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/seamus/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/seamus/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Suki Waddel</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/suki/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/suki/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Suki and I’m running for ANUSA General Representative in 2025. As a Gen Rep on
the RAGE Ticket, I am committed to delivering the services you need, building the campus you
want, and fighting for the education you deserve.
I’m a first-year Law and PPE student, originally from Sydney, and I’m passionate about getting
involved in student politics. I want to be part of a team that not only supports student voices and
concerns, but also acts on them.
If elected, I will remain committed to the policies I’ve outlined, while also being adaptable and
responsive to other issues brought to me by you, the students.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tessa McNamara</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/tessa/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/tessa/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;CW: Sexual Assault / Sexual Harassment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi ANU, I’m Tessa McNamara (she/her) and I’m running to be a GenRep for ANUSA 2026. I believe that it is the responsibility of ANUSA to ensure a safe and comfortable learning environment for the students of ANU, as well as advocating against any cuts to the quality of our education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first year PPE/Arts student from interstate, I’m so grateful for the welcoming community I’ve found at ANU, but understand how tough university life can be. Uni should be a time of learning and socialising, but with stressors like exams, social/financial anxiety and moving away from home, mental health support is vital to students&amp;rsquo; wellbeing and should be protected by your student union.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tyne Jones</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/tyne/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/tyne/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hey ANU!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is &lt;strong&gt;Tyne&lt;/strong&gt;, and I am running to be a &lt;strong&gt;General Representative (Gen Rep)&lt;/strong&gt; on ANUSA. I want to be part of an ANUSA that represents and supports students, so that everyone feels that they are welcome, heard, and part of our campus community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a first year &lt;strong&gt;International Relations and Political Science&lt;/strong&gt; student, passionate about productive government–NFP (not-for-profit) relationships and Australia’s evolving role in the Indo-Pacific. A student from Sydney, I currently work with a government and media relations firm and am a member of the Ku-ring-gai Council Youth Advisory Committee, experiences that have given me insight into effective advocacy, community engagement, and representation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
