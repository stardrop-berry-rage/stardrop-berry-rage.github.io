      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey ANU! My name is Aurora (she/her) and I am running to be your 2026 ANUSA Education Officer. The ANU’s priority should be the education and research it is globally renowned for, transparency and accountability; I will hold the ANU to account in delivering the quality of education and experience every single student deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Undergraduate CASS Representative on ANUSA this year, I’ve seen and felt your rage at the position our University is in. I am ready and willing to fight for your education and deliver the representation, support, and transparency every student deserves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Charley Ellwood (he/him), and I am a third year student from the Gold Coast studying a double degree of PPE/Public Policy. I am currently the President of Burgmann College, a Board director for Inspire Tomorrow Education, and the 2025 ANUSA Undergraduate Coursework Officer (UGCO). Having been on the SRC for two years, both as a Gen Rep and now UGCO, I feel immensely passionate about ANUSA, the work we do currently, and the work that we must continue to do. That is exactly why I am running to be your 2026 ANUSA President.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRANSPARENCY AND PROCESSES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSAF POLICY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In 2026, ANUSA’s funding agreement is up for negotiation with the university. We currently receive 55% of the student services and amenities fee, known as SSAF. This is student money, and I firmly believe it belongs in student hands. &lt;strong&gt;I will advocate for an increase in the union’s funding&lt;/strong&gt;, while also acknowledging that the university currently uses SSAF money to fund other student services. &lt;strong&gt;We deserve more of our student money in student hands.&lt;/strong&gt; While the university-run services are vital, elected students are best placed to know what students need, and we need to be able to fund this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there! I’m Stella (she/her), and I’m running to be your 2026 Vice President with RAGE. I’m a third year Security Studies and Arts student, and over the past two years I’ve been heavily involved with college Residents’ Committees and student life, having been Burton and Garran Hall’s Secretary in 2024 and College President in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this involvement, I’m intimately aware of the relationship between regular students, ANU departments and ANUSA. I’ve experienced how difficult it can be to navigate the ANU’s bureaucracy and systems, from financial support to wellbeing services to educational processes. As it stands, our services are not effectively reaching those who need them most, which means our services are underutilised and our voices aren’t heard. ANUSA works best when students understand its services and find it an approachable and welcoming space for all; as your Vice President, I endeavor to bridge the gap between students and representatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
