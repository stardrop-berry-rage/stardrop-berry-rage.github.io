I am currently the President of Burgmann College, a Board director for Inspire Tomorrow Education, and the 2025 ANUSA Undergraduate Coursework Officer (UGCO). Having been on the SRC for two years, both as a Gen Rep and now UGCO, I feel immensely passionate about ANUSA, the work we do currently, and the work that we must continue to do. That is exactly why I am running to be your 2026 ANUSA President.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kamal Hassan</title><link>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/kamal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:25:31 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://rageforanusa.com/candidates/kamal/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="manifesto-1--postgraduate-coursework-officer"&gt;Manifesto 1 – Postgraduate Coursework Officer&lt;/h2&gt;

Running with RAGE for ANUSA 2025&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postgraduate students are the heart of ANU’s teaching and research, yet we are too often treated as an afterthought. From rushed technological changes to declining academic standards and cost-cutting, our learning conditions are at stake. I’m running to ensure that &lt;strong&gt;postgraduates have a strong voice inside ANUSA&lt;/strong&gt; and that ANU delivers the world-class experience we were promised.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
