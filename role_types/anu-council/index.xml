      <description>&lt;p&gt;Experience matters. Over the past year, we have built a student union that is financially stable, that has expanded student services, and that has successfully advocated for students at the highest levels of the university. This is not the time for risky experiments; it&amp;rsquo;s the time for a steady hand to continue the work and deliver even more for ANU students.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As your current General Representative, I have a proven track record of getting things done. I have the relationships and the know-how to hit the ground running from day one. I&amp;rsquo;m running for President because I have a realistic plan to build on our success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
