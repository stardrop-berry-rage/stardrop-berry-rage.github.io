                <p class="muted">Running for: <strong>Education Officer</strong></p>
            
            <div class="prose">
                <p>Hey ANU! My name is Aurora (she/her) and I am running to be your 2026 ANUSA Education Officer. The ANU’s priority should be the education and research it is globally renowned for, transparency and accountability; I will hold the ANU to account in delivering the quality of education and experience every single student deserves.</p>
<p>As Undergraduate CASS Representative on ANUSA this year, I’ve seen and felt your rage at the position our University is in. I am ready and willing to fight for your education and deliver the representation, support, and transparency every student deserves.</p>
<p>If elected as your Education Officer, I have four primary areas of policy: tangible action fighting course cuts, centralisation of support services, and the declining quality of our educational experiences; the creation of structured ANUSA Education Support services; reform in student communication processes from a University and ANUSA level; and transparent, accessible education policy from the ANU.</p>
<p>These policies reflect the advocacy I would deliver as a passionate student, experienced member of ANUSA, and committed Education Officer.</p>
<p><strong>Structured ANUSA Educational Support</strong></p>
<p>ANUSA’s services should aim to improve the broad University experience for every single student that is part of our community; it’s vital for all students to feel supported in their academic experience whilst at University. As Education Officer, I will work to develop an educational-based structured support system through collaboration with the incoming Vice President and College Representatives. Colleges have student support offices, however in the current context of centralisation of student support (led by cuts to the DVCA portfolio and Renew ANU), I believe it’s imperative for ANUSA to step up and provide consistent, reliable, and structured academic support to all students - undergraduate, postgraduate, or HDR.</p>
<p>College-specific consultation sessions</p>
<p>Over the last few months, ANU has seen cuts to student academic support - drop-in sessions in the CoSM, the loss of the Enquiries Team at the CoL, reduced support hubs in CAP. The implementation of college-specific consultation sessions, facilitated by ANUSA and the Education Officer, ensures students retain access to tailored academic support and direct representation, countering the effects of centralisation with college-specific expertise and student-led advocacy.</p>
<p>These sessions will be facilitated by myself, incoming college reps, and relevant academics, occurring twice per Semester. Focus areas of these sessions will include assessment feedback, course-specific support, and navigating college systems, all shaped by student input through nomination of relevant focus areas prior to sessions. Students will have the ongoing opportunity to consult with college reps, myself as Education Officer, and relevant academics who understand disciplinary cultures and college systems intimately.</p>
<p>Session outcomes will inform ANUSA’s academic advocacy and be reported to relevant university bodies. I will work with the Undergraduate and Postgraduate Coursework Officers to identify key areas of support and actionable support gaps differing between disciplines.</p>
<p>Past exams and papers database</p>
<p>Too often are students left with little guidance surrounding completion of exams or assessments - having previous examples to practice and support education is key. As Education Officer, I will establish a past exams and papers database to enhance every student’s ability to make the most of their education and learning experience. I plan to work with the Disabilities Students’ Association, the incoming Vice President, and relevant colleges towards ensuring that the database is accessible (i.e., through screen-reader compatibility and high-contrast scanning) for all students.</p>
<p>Key course study sessions</p>
<p>I will implement key course study sessions facilitated by ANUSA as an EDC initiative, targeting high-enrolment, high-pressure courses across disciplines offering a structured space for peer-led academic support. Promoting a culture that fosters collaborative learning environments is imperative when fighting to protect our education; this is a method of ensuring student community and shared academic support to combat diminishing support structures. I would integrate this as a path for nominated class representatives from such key courses to get involved and help run these sessions, ideally with structured sessions in the lead up to exam periods.</p>
<p>‘How to use AI ethically’ assistance</p>
<p>The use of Artificial Intelligence in University is something that continues to evolve and grow - however, a lack of clear University policy surrounding how to use it and navigate academic integrity has resulted in gaps between colleges and a lack of student clarity. As Education Officer, I would provide assistance (either in the form of a workshop, online resource, or pamphlet) as to using AI ethically whilst studying at University. The guidelines for using AI as a student studying in the College of Arts and Social Sciences is vastly different to the purposes of utilising AI as a student in the College of Systems and Society. That’s why, as Education Officer, I will provide assistance to students around utilising digital literacy skills and balancing academic integrity, alongside collaboration with the incoming Undergraduate Coursework Officer.</p>
<p>Alongside ANUSA assistance in navigating AI academically, I will push for clear and consistent University policy regarding the use of AI. A lack of consistency across the University as to guiding students as to proper practice using AI has led to students being unjustly penalised. Further, current flagging processes for AI disproportionately targets students with English as a second language and many disabled students, often flagging spell-check and translations as academic misconduct. I will fight to develop a comprehensive and student-centric University AI strategy so students are supported and not penalised for a lack of guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Improving student communication processes</strong></p>
<p>One of the most consistent issues we’ve seen over the past few years is a lack of information sharing and communication with students when it comes to changes and decisions that impact our degrees. As Education Officer, I plan to address this in two complementary ways; every student needs to know what is happening to their education.</p>
<p>Establishment of a ‘Right to Know’ campaign</p>
<p>As Education Officer, I plan to lead this campaign alongside collaboration with the incoming Vice-President to advocate for students receiving clear and accessible information from the University regarding matters related to all aspects of their education. This would be achieved through a cross-college audit, examining the current communication processes in practice across disciplines, and proposing a streamlined approach that prioritises timely, clear, and regular updates of changes from a college level. Students need to know about changes in their colleges, updates to their courses, dates for public meetings or feedback proposals when it is happening, not when convenient for the University.</p>
<p>I will also work to support the incoming Vice-President in de-mystifying existing support services available to students (such as appeals processes, complaints, and deferral of exams) by creating a resource bank that enhances students’ knowledge of the academic services and supports available to them.</p>
<p>Implementation of an ‘Ed Officer Update’ in ANUSA communication</p>
<p>Alongside reforms to University communication practices to students, I think more could be done at an ANUSA level towards outreach to students when it comes to education. I would implement a regular ‘Ed Officer Update’ through official ANUSA channels, such as the Newsletter and social media recaps, to succinctly and clearly communicate what I’ve been doing in my capacity as Education Officer, what changes/updates students need to be aware of, and relevant contacts for support. Transparency is imperative to any executive role; I believe regular communication from the Ed Officer directly to students not only facilitates this, but bridges a gap in understanding University processes and rapid changes in Education by providing clear updates.</p>
<p><strong>Transparent and accessible University educational policy</strong></p>
<p>As your Education Officer I will fight to provide the education every single student not only needs, but deserves. One of the key ways towards achieving this is through assessing and re-working existing University coursework policies to be more accessible and transparent.</p>
<p>Extenuating Circumstances Applications (ECAs) work</p>
<p>I will fight for mandatory inclusion of ECA information in course outlines and Canvas pages; visibility of information is essential for equity, especially for students navigating unexpected challenges. To improve implementation, I will push for clearer communication and targeted training for staff on how to enact ECA provisions. The current ECA system is centrally managed, and often places a disproportionate burden on individual staff members, who are expected to make adjustments without guidance.</p>
<p>We know that there will always be work to be done when it comes to educational accessibility, and this extends to the development of ECA processes at our University. As Education Officer, I will continue to push the ANU to ensure ECAs are understandable, accessible, and equitable. I will work with the DSA, the incoming VP, and Student Assistance Team to advocate for student representation, and push for the presence of student voices in these important matters. I intend to focus on ECA improvement when it comes to the role of supplementary exams being an accommodation within ECAs, and applications involving multi-item assessments, as well as the diverse reasons students need to apply for ECAs, fighting to remove stigma and ableism at an institutional level in my advocacy.</p>
<p>I also will fight to remove barriers to receiving ECA support for international students alongside the ISD, addressing barriers present like burdensome documentation processes involving lengthy translation of resources. I will advocate and work to provide clearer information regarding existing translation processes to foster a more equitable ECA system for all students who need it.</p>
<p>Clarity around Educational Access Plans (EAPs)</p>
<p>EAPs are an integral part of educational accessibility - hundreds of students rely on the accommodations provided to ensure they receive the support they need. However, with cuts to Accessibility staffing and increased wait times, the path to getting an EAP has become inaccessible.</p>
<p>A large part of EAP implementation relies on course convenor discretion - this is not only problematic due to the lack of training staff receive regarding EAPs, but also due to the lack of a formalised response to ensure student safety and advocacy in University policy. Proposed centralisation under Renew ANU not only impacts our educational experiences, but the way in which teaching is delivered, alongside staff training. I will fight to ensure that staff training is incorporated across all colleges when it comes to ECAs, EAPs, and approaching accessibility in a professional and non-ableist manner. As Education Officer, I will dedicate myself to being the strong voice of student opinions in these meetings, advocating for student support and adequate staff training at every level (not just convenor). I will also endeavour to bring relevant Department Officers in the room, as every voice and student matters when it comes to advocating for accessible education. Being in the room is powerful, and I will always be present and strong in my convictions.</p>
<p>Further, as Education Officer I plan to develop a ‘waiting period protocol’ to assist students waiting for an EAP alongside the DSA, the Student Assistance Team, and Accessibility. Whilst the context of Renew ANU remains in flux for next year, I hope to establish a more formalised process students can turn to when waiting for documentation. This would be characterised by clear steps to take once registered for an EAP, what provisions a student can ask for whilst waiting, and establishing a clear link between Accessibility and convenors as a contact point, alongside increasing awareness amongst students of the difference between convenor assessments and centrally administered exams. This establishes a focus on removing the burden of continuous self-advocacy many disabled students face simply to receive a more equitable education.</p>
<p>I also plan to work with the incoming HDR Coursework Officer to formalise an approach to accessibility and the role of EAPs that is more suitable to Higher Degree Research students, not only catering to the needs of undergraduate/postgraduate students. The rights of students should be supported through adequate resourcing - this matters now more than ever in the uncertainty of Renew ANU. The University should be dedicating resources to accessibility teams that support all students; structural support should extend to HDR students. This is something I will fight for as Education Officer.</p>
<p>Late withdrawals reform</p>
<p>The current late withdrawal system at ANU unjustly disadvantages students who wish to take control over their education and follow their own path; it is inaccessible and harmful. It aims to prevent students from completing late withdrawal, rather than provide services conducive to supporting any student who changes their mind. Aside from this, it is also discriminatory, requiring students to provide extensive evidence from themselves and medical professionals (a long and expensive process) within a short timeline, and disproportionately impacting students with ongoing conditions or fluctuating circumstances. As Education Officer, I will fight for a more equitable late withdrawal system that prioritises student safety and support; reform must centre students’ interests, compassion, and the right to change course without punitive barriers.</p>
<p>Accessible assessment policy</p>
<p>Every student deserves a University experience that is accessible to them; that’s why, as Education Officer, I will be fighting for the following changes to the University’s assessment policy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standardisation of assessment times</strong>; I will push for the standardised 11:59pm submission time, rather than differing assessments due at 10am or 4pm. Students deserve consistency and stability, especially considering the majority of students balance study with work.</li>
<li><strong>Abolishing mid-Semester assessments</strong>; students deserve the opportunity to utilise the mid-Semester break as a time to step away. The inclusion of assessments throughout this break prohibits students from ‘logging off’.</li>
<li><strong>Abolishing the 6:30pm mid-Sem exam time slot</strong>; we know that nighttime exams are not only inaccessible to students who work, but that they are also unsafe for many students living off campus. We’ve removed 6:30pm exams for end-of-Semester exams: I will fight for the same for mid-Semester exams.</li>
<li><strong>Abolishing Saturday exams in Semester 2</strong>; again, Saturday exams are an example of inaccessible assessment policy that places working students at a disadvantage. I will fight to remove Saturday exams in Semester 2 of 2026.</li>
<li><strong>Clearer participation guidelines for staff and students</strong>; for so many students, a large sum of their course grade is contingent on ‘participation’ in the course - however, what this participation requires, is often unclear. Further, with more tutorials occurring by fortnight, and higher class sizes, students need clarification about how they are being assessed. As Education Officer, I plan to implement clearer participation guidelines by discipline, push for clearer processes for notifying absences, and options for alternative engagement (i.e., reflections, forum posts, or peer feedback). I will work with faculties to ensure these guidelines are embedded in course outlines and communicated early in the semester.</li>
<li><strong>Continuing work on BYOD exams</strong>; in conjunction with the incoming Vice-President I plan to continue the push for Bring Your Own Device Exams.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advocacy against course cuts</strong></p>
<p>The ANU is in crisis - we see our student support services being stripped away, our residential experiences under attack, and the quality of our education being gutted. It has been a privilege to utilise my position as CASS Representative this year to fight against these cuts and advocate for our education; it is a fight I am ready to continue next year as Education Officer.</p>
<p>Fighting for mandated student consultation</p>
<p>At the heart of these cuts lies a disregard for student experience; it is now more than ever that we need students in the room where decisions are made and the opportunity to make their voices heard. As Education Officer, I will not only use my position as an opportunity to push against cuts that detrimentally attack our education, but fight for mandated student consultation prior to any proposed changes.</p>
<p>The University’s provision of minimal feedback channels is tokenistic, and reflects no shift towards valuing student voices, treating consultation as a box to quickly tick off. I will fight for student consultation at every step of the way; whether this is through CEC membership, engagement through communication channels, open town halls, or through utilisation of student protest. I will also use education settings like EDC and EdCom to establish an ongoing ‘Students Against Cuts’ working group that can monitor and respond to restructuring proposals with counter-recommendations from students themselves, develop accessible resources to empower other students to push back against the cuts, and push for student ratification of major policy changes affecting our educational experiences.</p>
<p>Supporting student advocacy and protest</p>
<p>I will continue to empower student protest in an Education Officer capacity to fight against the ANU’s rapid centralisation and decline in educational quality. The cuts happening at ANU (from ResComs, courses, degrees, and student support) are done without adequate student consultation and place students in unjust positions. As your Education Officer I will advocate so student consultation is at the forefront of every decision made, and keep working in the Ed Officer activist role alongside student protest groups. Student protest is a necessary and powerful form of fighting, not something to be managed - I will use my position to enhance it, alongside mobilising governance platforms to challenge cuts, propose alternatives with student consultation, and hold ANU’s decision-makers accountable.</p>
<p>As an ANUSA representative this year, I have worked with protest groups and spoken at rallies; I’ve written and published student support resources; I’ve run education-based events; I have helped students with course concerns and uncertainty; I have fought and advocated for students and delivered what I promised.</p>
<p>I am proud to be a student at the ANU, and I know we can do better as an institution - this is why I am ready to turn rage into action as your Education Officer in 2026.</p>
